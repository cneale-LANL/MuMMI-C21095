THESE ARE NOTES FROM CHRIS NEALE TO HIMSELF ABOUT THINGS THAT REMAIN TO BE DONE

- add an actual check based on the MAXIMUM_RESTRAINT_UNSATISFACTION and mark runs as a failure if they fail that test
  - could also make a subset posre .itp file that is used to test the really critical parts also in success.gro
    since it should be OK for SC to rearrange after restratints are removed, but we want the secondary structure elements to not fall apart

- rebalance the charge by removing some ions far from the protein (changed the PIP2 charge)

- Ring penetration: Charmm gui does this via findrings.py and pentest.py 
    - quoting charmm-gui: "The protein surface penetration check finds the lipid tails that go beyond the protein surface, and the lipid ring penetration check
                          detects the lipid tails that pass through the cyclic groups (e.g., cholesterol ring) in the simulation systems. Energy minimization 
                          can resolve many of these bad contacts, but one might need to visually check the following lipid molecules to ensure the following 
                          contacts are resolved. The user can regenerate the lipid bilayer if necessary."
    - algorithm is described here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165794/

- If there is a "molecule" that is actually multiple segments (like ras+raf) then I'm going to get spurious detection of omega cis
    - this is fixed, but only by ignoring CYF-*, NMA-* and *-ACE pairs. If the proteins are not capped like this then this script deck
      will still get spurious detection of "problems" that are not really a problem

- add some tests that the build has worked
  - RMSD to template, + max RMSdev per residue. Want to know if a side chain got trapped between two beta strands during the build

- careful of histidine protonation, both in generation of the toplogy for the run and also in the distance restraint file

- water around GTP and Mg2+ (1st solvation shell of Mg2+ should be full)
  - has been addressed by simply adding these waters -- need to check if that is the desired approach

- water in the protein core? -- is it reasonable? Not checked.

- check lipid parameters and overall force field. Right now, I just imported some definitions from charmm-gui output
  - note that I made modifications to the C-linked dihedral parameters for SSM (involving X-NHL-C-X proper dihedrals, as taken from protein backbone)
  - the goal of this script deck is to provide output configurations for the AA simulations, not to prepare the AA simulations.
    Therefore, the onus of ensuring parameter correctness is not on this script deck and needs to be handled separately

- check that chirality requirements are actually correct 
  - for pip2 and cholesterol, I just looked at structural averaged from a charmm-gui build and enforced those. 
    Presumably I could change anything, but at least it needs to be verified
